# Jaybot
An open-source Discord bot for the Zombie Horde Minecraft server, built with a TypeScript-Discord.js-ExpressJS backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

Now powered by Cannicide's [Brynjolf suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brynjolf/commands) - a set of efficient, powerful, and adaptive systems for command creation, command handling, and event handling! Combined with TypeScript, this suite makes Discord bot creation easier and more powerful than ever before.

## Features
- Statistics Discord channels that show how many players are on the Minecraft server and whether the server is online
- Suggestions system that adds yea/nay votes to messages sent in the suggestions channels
- Automatically add a specific role when users accept the rules
- Allow users to react to a message to gain reaction roles
- Advanced rank system based on server activity, with custom rank card images and a dynamic leaderboard webpage made with React
- Command to explain PluralKit, to avoid admins needing to repeatedly explain it themselves
