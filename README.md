# panacea
An open-source Discord bot for the Zombie Horde Minecraft server, built on Discord.js, ExpressJS, and React.

Now powered by Cannicide's [djs-vidar](https://npmjs.com/package/djs-vidar) command creation and handling system, with support for Discord API v10 and Discord.js v14!

Panacea connects Discord, Minecraft, and Trello together with her powerful statistics and bug-reporting features. Advanced statistics features allow for viewing months of graphed statistics data (as well as graphs for daily and weekly user activity on both Discord and Minecraft), displaying the current Minecraft player count within Discord through a voice channel's name (updated every minute), and more. Further connections between these platforms, and perhaps other platforms, are planned for the future.
