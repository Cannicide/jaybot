# panaceabot
A completely open-source discord bot for the Zombie Horde minecraft server, built on discord.js and expressJS. Features include a giveaway system, paginated help command, random map selector, interactive poll command (with progress bars), multiple forms of statistics for both Discord and Minecraft servers, an advanced yet easy-to-use bug-reporting system, suggestion votes, and more. Updates arrive every few weeks, and sometimes occur daily.

Utilizes the Jay Command Class and associated custom command handler, storage system, interface system, and interpreter system all created entirely by Cannicide#2753 over the course of several years of gradually evolving improvements to core bot systems. Contains some of the most up-to-date, powerful, and advanced features out of all of Cannicide's bots.

Panacea connects Discord, Minecraft, and Trello together with her powerful statistics and bug-reporting features. Advanced statistics features allow for viewing months of graphed statistics data (as well as graphs for daily and weekly user activity on both Discord and Minecraft), displaying the current Minecraft player count within Discord through a voice channel's name (updated every minute), and more. Further connections between these platforms, and perhaps other platforms, are planned for the future.
